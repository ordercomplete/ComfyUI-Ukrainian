LTX Tiled Sampler v2.3

Spatially-tiled drop-in replacement for SamplerCustomAdvanced. Designed
for upscale-pass refinement of LTX2 video latents where conditioning
gets diluted at upscaled token counts.

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v2.3
================================================================================
- Added bypass_tiling parameter. When True, the node acts as a
  transparent passthrough to standard SamplerCustomAdvanced semantics:
  one sampling pass on the full input (video+audio together if wrapper),
  no tiling, no extraction/reconstruction overhead. Equivalent to not
  having this node in the workflow at all.
- Useful for: A/B comparison against tiled output, small inputs where
  tiling adds nothing, debugging whether issues are tile-related or
  sampling-related (e.g., GPU attention library compatibility issues).

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v2.2
================================================================================
- Fixed no-tile single-pass wrapper output: v2.1 passed guider.sample's
  result through directly, but that wrapper has cached input refs in
  .tensors slots (same as tile-path discovery from v2.0). Downstream
  splitters that do latents[1] for audio hit IndexError because the
  wrapper output ended up with only one tensor.
- v2.2 applies the same x0-unflatten technique as the tile path's carrier
  to extract both sampled video and audio from the no-tile sampling,
  then reconstructs the wrapper for downstream compatibility.
- Single sampling pass for video+audio is preserved (no extra steps).
- Falls back gracefully: if x0 unflatten fails, tries _extract_components
  on raw_result; if that fails, uses passthrough audio with input video.

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v2.1
================================================================================
- No-tile path now samples wrapper directly when audio is present.
  Previously the auto-skip fallback ran video-only sampling, which meant
  audio passed through unsampled — different behavior from what users
  would get from standard SamplerCustomAdvanced. v2.1 mirrors stock
  behavior in the no-tile case: video+audio sampled together in one
  natural pass, wrapper output flows through unchanged.
- New helper _single_pass_wrapper for this path. Preserves the original
  wrapper object so downstream node compatibility (latents[1] access)
  works without our flatten/unflatten machinery.
- audio_pass / audio_carrier_tile settings are now correctly ignored in
  the no-tile case (they only apply when tiling is actually happening).

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v2.0
================================================================================
- DISCOVERED: LTX wrapper sampling stores its output in a flattened
  combined-tensor form via the x0 capture, NOT in the wrapper's .tensors
  slots. Reading via _extract_components on tile_result returns the
  ORIGINAL INPUT REFERENCES (cached at construction time), which is why
  v1.9's "extracted video" had correct shape but wrong (input) content.
- v2.0 fix: capture the x0 callback during sampling, apply
  process_latent_out, and unflatten the resulting combined tensor
  manually. Math: total_elements = video_shape.numel + audio_shape.numel.
  First chunk reshaped as video, remainder as audio.
- This unflatten approach correctly retrieves both modalities from the
  carrier wrapper sampling pass, preserving video-audio cross-attention
  for lipsync.
- Added value-range diagnostics to confirm video/audio content is
  actually sampled (not stale input or zero-buffer).

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v1.9 (extra process_latent_out — INSUFFICIENT)
================================================================================
- UNIFIED carrier-tile sampling: video and audio are now sampled TOGETHER
  in a single wrapper-input pass on the carrier tile. This preserves
  the model's video-audio cross-attention (essential for lipsync).
- Root cause of v1.6's "blank video" issue identified: the wrapper output
  contains video in raw model coordinate space, but our code was
  accumulating it directly without applying process_latent_out().
  Plain-video sampling applies this internally in guider.sample;
  wrapper extraction must do it manually. v1.9 applies it correctly.
- Non-carrier tiles still sample plain video (same as v1.7+). Audio is
  the same across all tiles (full sequence) so non-carrier audio data
  isn't useful and isn't computed.
- Cost: same as plain tiled sampling. No extra forward passes.

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v1.8 (audio captured via separate pass — REVERTED)
================================================================================
- Restored audio_pass="tile_carrying" with a working architecture:
  - Every tile samples plain video as before (correct video output)
  - On the carrier tile ONLY, an ADDITIONAL wrapper-sampling pass runs
    purely to capture sampled audio. The video output of that pass is
    discarded (we already have correct video from the plain pass).
  - Cost: one extra full-schedule sampling pass on the carrier tile.
    For your 3-step config that's 3 extra forward passes total.
- Audio is the same across all tiles (full sequence), so we only need
  to capture it once — from the chosen carrier tile.
- audio_carrier_tile parameter is again functional ('first' / 'middle'
  / 'last' selects which tile's wrapper pass captures the audio).

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v1.7 (audio sampling temporarily reverted)
================================================================================
- Reverted carrier-tile audio sampling: the wrapper round-trip
  (input wrapper → guider.sample → output wrapper) reliably produces an
  output where only the audio modality reflects sampling — the video
  modality is returned blank/unchanged. Net effect: blank video tile in
  carrier, defeating the purpose of tiled sampling. v1.7 reverts carrier
  to plain-video sampling.
- audio_pass="tile_carrying" preserved as a parameter for forward compat
  but currently produces identical output to "passthrough". Audio
  smoothing alongside tiled video is not currently supported by this
  node — addressing it requires deeper LTX guider integration than this
  drop-in replacement can provide.
- audio_carrier_tile parameter is currently unused; preserved for future
  reactivation.

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v1.6
================================================================================
- Fixed carrier-tile denoised x0 handling: when on the carrier tile, the
  x0_output['x0'] is the full wrapper (video+audio). v1.5's isinstance check
  didn't catch wrappers that subclass torch.Tensor — leaked audio data into
  the denoised video accumulator, causing dimension-mismatch crashes.
  v1.6 unconditionally extracts components on carrier tiles AND verifies
  the extracted video shape matches tile_samples shape before accumulating.
- Added shape verification on carrier tile_samples extraction: if the
  extracted video doesn't match the input tile shape, fall back to plain
  video sampling for that tile rather than corrupt the accumulator.

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v1.5
================================================================================
- New audio_pass="tile_carrying" mode: audio rides along with one chosen
  tile's sampling instead of an extra full pass. Zero extra sampling steps.
- audio_carrier_tile parameter: 'first' / 'middle' / 'last' selects which
  tile carries the audio. 'first' (default) for vertical talking-face
  workflows where the upper half typically contains the speaker. 'middle'
  for very large outputs (4K/8K) where speakers are typically center.
- tile_overlap default raised from 6 to 8 (empirically hides seams better).
- Memory optimisations: explicit del of per-tile intermediates, full_noise
  buffer freed after tile loop, fp32 accumulators freed after dtype cast,
  torch.cuda.empty_cache() between tiles when on CUDA.
- Audio shape sanity check: if captured audio shape doesn't match original,
  fall back to passthrough rather than ship malformed audio downstream
  (guard against ffmpeg errors).

================================================================================
CHANGES IN v1.3
================================================================================
- Fixed: '.ndim()' bug introduced in v1.2 (ndim is a property, not a method).
- Fixed: NestedTensor handling. LTX-Video wraps video+audio in a custom
  NestedTensor-like class that does NOT subclass torch.Tensor, so the
  v1.2 isinstance() check fell through to torch.as_tensor() which failed.
- v1.3 detects multiple NestedTensor formats:
    - PyTorch standard torch.NestedTensor (subclass of torch.Tensor)
    - LTX-Video custom NestedTensor wrapper (not a torch.Tensor subclass)
    - Tuple/list of tensors
    - Plain tensor (passthrough)

================================================================================
APPROACH
================================================================================
Whole-pipeline tiling for light refinement passes:
  1. Split video latent spatially along chosen axis with overlap.
  2. Generate full-size noise once; slice per-tile for consistent overlap noise.
  3. Run FULL sampling pipeline on each tile independently.
  4. Cosine-window blend tile outputs.

In tile_carrying audio mode, the chosen carrier tile receives the full
audio component alongside its video slice for sampling. The model's
video-audio cross-attention runs naturally during that tile's pass.
Sampled audio is captured from the result.

Suited for: 3-step euler_ancestral_cfg_pp upscale refinement (sigmas like
[0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0]) with distilled CFG=1.

NOT suited for: heavy denoise from pure noise (tiles diverge too much).
